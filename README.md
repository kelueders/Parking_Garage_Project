# Parking_Garage_Project
We pair programmed most of the project, coming up with the overall ideas collaboratively. We also debugged together. Saraa did the final touches including the loop to prevent the program from stalling if the user mistypes an answer. Kate did formatting and touch ups as well in between working collaboratively.
